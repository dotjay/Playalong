Playalong TODO
==============

 * Stop offscreen divs causing scrollbars by containing them in a div with overflow: hidden;
 * Add all the lines of a song to the DOM in one go rather than during playback.
 * Align the song lines horizontally, scrolling each line from left to right at a speed that reflects the current measure, i.e. calculate animation time based on the width of the current line of text making sure that the next line can be seen to the right before it is due to be played. This should be a lot less jarring, and should mean that song line length should no longer be an issue.
 * Allow `{start_of_verse}`/`{end_of_verse}` directives in chord files.
 * Keyboard controls, e.g. space bar for start/stop.
 * A better way of importing chord files: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
 * Better font stacks: http://daringfireball.net/misc/2007/07/iphone-osx-fonts http://unitinteractive.com/blog/2008/06/26/better-css-font-stacks/
